Mowbly - Open Enterprise Mobility Platform - Cross platform SDK

Mowbly mobile SDK is an open source, enterprise mobile app foundation layer. The primary objective of Mowbly is to keep focus on enterprise features alone. Mowbly APIs are exposed as standard Javascript APIs which are used with HTML and CSS to build cross platform apps. It has been built to fit into the larger goal of creating a single stack enterprise mobility platform (SDK, UI, Studio, Simulator, Management, Monitoring, Analytics, Backend & Remote Support).
